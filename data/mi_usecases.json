      "Long description" : "Intentcasting, where a potential customer solicits purchasing intents to selected vendors has been proposed by many, but still lacks significant traction.\n\nThe purpose of this use-case is to identify relevant sub-use-cases in order to locate and address possible barriers related to these.\n\nThis could include, but not necessarily be limited to:\n\n1. Discovering relevant vendors\n2. Qualifying relevant vendors\n3. Contacting relevant vendors\n4. Managing/negotiating bids from vendors\n5. Establishing trusted relations\n6. Initiating and conduction transactions\n6. Recording all relevant transactional data on behalf of the user\n\nEven though the sub-use-cases may be handled by different services, it is essential that they can cooperate in an effective way to ensure a good overall experience (including ease, cost and reliability) for both consumers and vendors.\n\nI have attached a draft discussion paper that relates to a proposed solution to the sub-use-cases #1 and #5. We are presently in discussions with authorities and major organizations in Denmark to introduce this model in a way that may be scaled to the EU level",
