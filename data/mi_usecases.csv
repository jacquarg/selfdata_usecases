Intentcast-based commerce,"How to make intentcast-based purchasing attractive to consumers and vendors in terms of ease, cost, and reliability compared to commerce based on traditional marketing concepts.","Intentcasting, where a potential customer solicits purchasing intents to selected vendors has been proposed by many, but still lacks significant traction.

The purpose of this use-case is to identify relevant sub-use-cases in order to locate and address possible barriers related to these.

This could include, but not necessarily be limited to:

1. Discovering relevant vendors
2. Qualifying relevant vendors
3. Contacting relevant vendors
4. Managing/negotiating bids from vendors
5. Establishing trusted relations
6. Initiating and conduction transactions
6. Recording all relevant transactional data on behalf of the user

Even though the sub-use-cases may be handled by different services, it is essential that they can cooperate in an effective way to ensure a good overall experience (including ease, cost and reliability) for both consumers and vendors.

I have attached a draft discussion paper that relates to a proposed solution to the sub-use-cases #1 and #5. We are presently in discussions with authorities and major organizations in Denmark to introduce this model in a way that may be scaled to the EU level",https://www.peercraft.com,"Intentcasting, VRM, Data driven, Discovery, Consent, Terms",Making & Implementing Better Decisions,,,Under development,Denmark,https://eu.jotform.com/uploads/dayquiri/60524863497364/336883136381437151/Discussion_Paper_on_DDDB_draft_v1_20151122.pdf

MesObjets,"With MesObjets, I can create my objects' inventory.
I centralize my shopping bills (and my shopping proofs), I can aggregate the information through Respublica.io and the Open Linked Data.

","With MesObjets, an individual can quickly and easily provide proof of purchase for this or that object. No need to stress about whether I kept my receipt to exchange a product in a store. In case of damage or theft, I have a quick access to an inventory of my objects, and I can provide proof of purchase. If I want to sell property I can easily prove that I purchased it. If I want to give an opinion on a object I can prove that I have it.

Example: ""Imagine my home is on fire and the file containing all of my bills has burned during the fire, it will be very difficult to prove that I had a leather jacket worth 3,500 euros. with MesObjets I could provide my insurer a list of all my objects and their proof of purchase. 

Moreover, the application wants to integrate our objects to the networks of ""Linked Open Data"" via the platform (under construction) Respublica.io and peers: Wikidata, OpenDataProduct ... Recovering a unique identifier - a bar code, ISBN, a Wikidata identifier - the user will potentially have access to information on the producer of the object, the composition of the object, or any safety or health alert on the object. In the future, we can imagine that each producer publishes data related to the object and regularly updates it. Other players could also link data with this item: consumer or environmental protection associations, for example. Having a recognizable unique identifier on the network, the data are reusable in multiple applications: future developments could focus on the opportunity to republish an offer to sell, rent, loan or donate an object with a single click!
